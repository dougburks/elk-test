This QUICK and DIRTY script should export logs from ELSA into log files that you can search using standard tools and/or import into Elasticsearch.

Exported log files will be written to $EXPORT.

WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMERS
* this script has NO error checking
* make sure you have plenty of free disk space as this is essentially duplicating all your logs
* this script has had very little testing
* this script is TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED!
* If this breaks your system, you get to keep both pieces!
* Use of this script may result in nausea, vomiting, or a burning sensation.
 
Once you've read all of the WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMERS above, please type AGREE to proceed:

If you would like to import these logs into Elastic, you can move them to /nsm/import/.

However, please be aware of a few things:

* Make sure you have plenty of free disk space as this is creating yet another copy of these logs.
* Logstash parsers only support the current version of Bro.  Older Bro logs may not be parsed properly.
